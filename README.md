# Digit Recognizer - Kaggle Competition
This is a CNN implementation with Keras in order to classify numbers. 
The dataset comes from the famous MNIST with the only difference that we have the pixels in the dataset.
So we have to find a way to extract images!

## Better wayw to improve:
* Insert a big model from Transfer Learning
* Train it on Google Colab with GPU and many epochs
