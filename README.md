# Digit Recognizer - Kaggle Competition

This is a CNN implementation with Keras in order to classify numbers.
The dataset comes from the famous MNIST with the only difference that we have the pixels in the dataset.
So we have to find a way to extract images!

## Better ways to improve:

- [ ] Insert an even bigger and better model with Transfer Learning?
- [ ] Use ImageDataGenerator!

## Scores:

1. **0.98932**
2. 0.98892
3. 0.98817
4. 0.98414

## Do not cheat!

There is known ways to cheat in Kaggle Competitions where you fill test_csv with train_csv data and so you know the answer! **Don't do that you ruin the concept**
